### Details

No specific software is needed to follow this tutorial. You do need
access to a Yoda instance, where you can log into the web portal. For
training hosted by SURF, the portal address is
[https://surf-yoda.irods.surfsara.nl](https://surf-yoda.irods.surfsara.nl){target="_blank"}.
For the addresses of institute-specific portals, see [this overview of
URL's](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/spaces/WIKI/pages/19824782/Yoda+Hosting#YodaHosting-YodaHosting){target="_blank"}.
Before you can login, course instructors should give you access to the
portal.
