Well done! You have now finished the exercises for today. You can be
proud of having completed some tough work today.

If you think anything is still unclear, do not hesitate to contact your
facilitators.

Thank you for your attention, and we hope to have been of help for you

-   A feature we have not touched in this hands-on session is
    Publishing. That is a next step in the flow after the Vault.
